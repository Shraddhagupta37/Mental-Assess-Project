A dedicated **Wellness Toolkit** with five interactive, immersive modes designed to calm your mind, sharpen your focus, and help you wind down — accessible anytime, anywhere:

*   **🌬️ Breathe** *(Relaxation, ~2–10 min)*: Guided breathing exercises with an animated visual circle that expands and contracts to your breath rhythm. Choose from four clinically-grounded patterns:
    *   **4-7-8 Relaxation** — activates the parasympathetic nervous system; ideal for sleep prep.
    *   **Box Breathing** — used by Navy SEALs for focus and grounding.
    *   **Calm Down** — extended exhale to reduce anxiety and heart rate.
